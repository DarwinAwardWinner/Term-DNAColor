=head1 NAME

Term::DNAColor - Add colors to DNA and RNA sequences in terminal output

=head1 VERSION

version 0.110210

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Term::DNAColor;

    print colordna("ATCGGTCNNNTAGCTGAN"), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a function, C<colordna>, that takes a DNA
sequence and wraps unambiguous nucleotides in ANSI color codes, so
that you can print the sequence to a terminal and have it come out
colored.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 colordna

Takes a string representing a DNA sequence and adds ANSI color codes
to the following nucleotides:

=over 4

=item *

A: green

=item *

T: red

=item *

C: blue

=item *

G: yellow

=back

U is colorized like T, to accomodate RNA sequences.

In addition, the entire sequence is rendered in bold.

This function is exported by default.

=head2 colorrna

This is simply an alias for C<colordna>. Unlike C<colordna>, it is not
exported by default, but only by request.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Colors are not configurable.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<rct+perlbug@thompsonclan.org>.
